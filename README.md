# TheGamingRoomSoftwareDesignDoc

-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The company "The Gaming Room" is a company that developed the game Draw It or Lose It which was a web-based game that they needed to be cross-compatible with mobile devices and various operating systems. They required a cross-platform architecture that would be scalable for a large user base and allow for growth/continous integration in a distributed environment.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I believe that I structured the document clearly and made it simple so that The Gaming Room's goals, system and business requirments, and possible technologies and solutions were met and complicated technical terminology such as architectures, constraints, etc were made to be easily understood by non-techincal and technical stakeholders.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found that the process of specifying and choosing the system requirments, technologies and operating system recommendations for the client was helpful when developing the code as it gave me a good foundation to build on and where to start.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise it would be the recomendations section which I would include more frameworks, libraries, and solutions to creating the application for IOS and Android in which would make it clear what tools will be used by the team.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the iser's needs and implemented them into my software design by ensuring that designing the game on iOS or Android met user's expectations and made the UI experience seemless for mobile gameplay while maintaining a similar design throughoout the platforms. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because user satisfaction ensures user's will spend more time on the game and recommend it to friends. If I ignored user experience then large scale adoption by oher user's wouldnt be possible because people would choose other games with a better exoerience.

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach used cloud-based for scalabilty and agnostic tools for the back-end server architecture such as APIs which would be aple to be accessed throughout web, mobile, and any other platforms without having to change any of the backend for the applications and I ensured the client-side developement followed the back-end server standards and requirments.
